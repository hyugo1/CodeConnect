# Code Connect!

**Code Connect** is a visual programming tool designed to help novices – even young children – learn the basics of coding by connecting Lego-like software components. With an intuitive drag‑and‑drop flowchart canvas, a palette of building blocks, and real‑time code generation, Code Connect offers a fun, interactive way to learn programming concepts while building simple apps.

## Key Features

- **Visual Flowchart Editor:**  
  Drag and drop blocks (such as Start, End, If Then, While, Output, Create/Change Variable, and Move Character) onto the canvas and connect them with intuitive edges.
  
- **Real‑Time Code Generation:**  
  Automatically generate JavaScript code from your flowchart. Preview, copy, and run the generated code to see how your program works.

- **Interactive Execution:**  
  Execute your flowchart step by step with built‑in delays and visual feedback. Watch the active block and edge animate during execution.

- **Project Persistence:**  
  Save your flowchart locally as JSON or in your account using Firebase authentication and Firestore. Import/export projects easily.

- **User Accounts and Authentication:**  
  Sign up, log in (or use Google sign‑in), and manage your saved projects directly from the application.

- **Built-In Examples and Guides:**  
  Explore examples (e.g. Hello World, If Then conditions, while loops) and access a “How to Play” guide for hints and instructions.

- **Responsive and Customizable UI:**  
  Toggle a right panel for a character display, console output, and generated code preview. Switch between light and dark modes to suit your environment.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and leverages libraries such as [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) for the flowchart editor and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for user authentication and project storage.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or later)
- npm or yarn
