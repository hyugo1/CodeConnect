Code Connect is a browser-based visual programming environment for beginners. Build “flowcharts” by dragging and connecting blocks, then execute step-by-step with animations, followed with console outputs and an animated character. Save or export your projects for later.

**Code Connect** differentiates itself from other block-based tools through:  
1. **Enhanced Control Flow** — enforced true/false branches, join-blocks, and color-coded edges.  
2. **Predefined Block Structure** — a minimal, task-specific palette that reduces cognitive load.

## Features

- **Visual Flowchart Editor**  
  Drag & drop blocks (Start, If, While, Variables, I/O, Move, Rotate, etc.) on a React Flow canvas, connect them, and see a live mini-map with zoom/pan controls.

- **Enhanced Control Flow**  
  Every `If` and `While` block auto-creates true/false placeholders and explicit join-blocks; edges are color-coded (green for true, red for false).

- **Immediate Execution Feedback**  
  Click **Run** to traverse your flowchart with DFS:  
  – Active blocks & edges highlight  
  – Console output streams line-by-line  
  – On-screen character moves, rotates, and “speaks” messages

- **Persistent Storage**  
  - **Local** via `localStorage` for quick saves without signup  
  - **Cloud** via Firebase Auth & Firestore (email/password or Google sign-in)

- **Export / Import JSON**  
  Serialize your diagram to JSON (positions, types, data) for offline backup or sharing.

- **Undo / Redo & Resizable Panels**  
  Edit history powered by `use-undo`; adjustable palette, canvas, and inspector widths with drag handles.

- **Theming & Accessibility**  
  Light/dark mode toggle, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and WCAG 2.1 AA contrast compliance.

- **Code Generation**  
  Generate equivalent JavaScript code from your flowchart via a visitor-based DFS code generator.
